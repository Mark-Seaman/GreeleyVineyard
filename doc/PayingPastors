Should churches pay pastors?
_____________________________________________________________________________

Lack of big picture

Four positions to understand pastor pay


**No pay**

If pastors serve others it is a priviledge.

They should be willing to give everything.

Paying them produces a false incentive and creates mixed motives.

In America people must work full time in order to care for their families.

The first tenth is God's; an investment in God's work is expected for four hours weekly.

Giving 20 hours to the church and 40 hours to an employer is not sustainable.

A pastor must never be asked to sacrifice their financial future, health, family, or
emotional well-being.


The church must protect its leaders by not forcing them to live in poverty.

A church that cannot pay its pastor should never expect more than four hours of
service per week.


In four hours a pastor can lead a single meeting weekly with no preparation.


**Minimum Wage**

Minimum wage is set up by the US government to prevent worker exploration by greedy
companies.

This does not apply to churches so it is legally possible to pay a pastor below
minimum wage.

If the pastor works 20 hours at a secular job that makes four times the income they
could also work for 20 hours for the church.

Median household income in the US in 2012 was $53k/year or $26/hour.

20 hours @ $25 + 20 hours @ $10 = 40 @ $17 or $35k/year.

This is above the poverty level of $24k/year for a family of four.

The 32% reduction in pay is offset by the good feeling of helping others.

This situation would work for a short period but is not sustainable.

It would only be acceptable for very log quality workers.


**Affordable Wage**

The top 5% of earners make more than $200K/year or $100/hr.

The is roughly 10 times the minimum wage.

Same churches (large ones) have huge budgets.  They run like corporations and pay
pastors at CEO rates.

A church of less than 200 cannot and should not pay at this level.

A healthy church should have 50% of its people tithing.

Median individual income is $25K/year.

A congregation of 100 people will have a gross income of $2.5 million.

A 50% tithing participation will set a budget of $125K/year.

Therefore a healthy congregation of 100 should have an annual budget of $125K.

A healthy budget distribution should be (30% building, 10% operations, 60% staffing).

This sets the staffing expense at $75K/year or ($37/hour).


**Opportunity Cost**

Any pastor could work a secular job.

The pastor chooses to sacrifice other opportunities to serve the church.

Churches should seek to close the gap between the opportunities inside and outside
the church.

Pastors have better than average skills and abilities.

Pastors moving into a secular job can make at least $60K/year or $30/hour.

Pastors make great sacrifices in many areas.

Financial hardship should not be added on by the church they serve.

If we want good leaders we must care for them.

As a church grows so does the complexity of leading it.

Salary for the senior leader should increase with a larger budget.

Staffing should also increase with growth.

Allocate a fixed percentage (say 30%) for all staff.

Estimated budget:
    People      Budget      Senior Pastor   Other Staff
    100         $125K/y     $60K/y          $15K/y
    200         $125K/y     $80K/y          $70K/y
    300         $375K/y     $100K/y         $125K/y
